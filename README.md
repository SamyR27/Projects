# Projects
These are some of the projects that i have tried making. I am very proud of sharing my projects to the world.

BlackJack:

For this I used javascript as back-end and HTML and CSS as front-end. Some of the functions that i used were: 

> getRandomcard() : This function used the math module. With this random number were generated between 1 to 11. Each number were associated with different cards.

> startgame() : When this function starts the game is alive.

> rendergame() : This function helps with the rule of blackjack. If the sum is 21, you win and if the sum is lower you get to choose a option of new card. The new card given is at random.
